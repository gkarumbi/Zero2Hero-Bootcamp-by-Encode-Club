**Decentralised Systems**

Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central server.

How would you solve the problems of
cheating - *I would involve seperate parties to watch over the players and ensure no one is cheating*

ensuring agreement about the state of the system - *after each turn is played confirm with the rest of the players on the state of the game*

communication problems (timeouts) - *Keep a paper record on the last state of the game*

how to decide who should take the next turn - *throw a dice*

how to allow the correct people to join the game - *have an intial list of people playing the game*

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed
design.
